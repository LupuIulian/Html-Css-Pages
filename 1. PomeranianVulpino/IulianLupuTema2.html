          These dogs are very active, energetic, and friendly. They quickly
          become attached to their owner and want to spend as much time as
          possible with him. However, they are unobtrusive. If they have
          something to do or lots of toys, they can easily endure loneliness. It
          can be a great watchdog at home because it barks very loudly despite
          its small size.Alert and intelligent, Pomeranians are easily trained
          and make fine watchdogs and perky pets for families with children old
          enough to know the difference between a toy dog and a toy. Poms are
          active but can be exercised with indoor play and short walks, so they
          are content in both the city and suburbs.
